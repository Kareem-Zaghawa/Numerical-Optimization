# Numerical-Optimization

## Overview

In this project, I have implemented various optimization techniques to train a chosen machine learning model. The project focuses on the following:

- Implementing first-order optimizers such as Gradient Descent (GD) and Momentum GD.
- Implementing a second-order optimizer using the BFGS algorithm.
- Comparing the performance of different optimizers on the chosen data and model.
- Presenting results through plots and tables.
